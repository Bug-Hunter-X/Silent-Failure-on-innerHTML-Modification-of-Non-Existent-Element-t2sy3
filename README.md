# Silent Failure on innerHTML Modification of Non-Existent Element
This example demonstrates an uncommon HTML/JavaScript error where attempting to modify the innerHTML of a non-existent element doesn't throw an error but simply fails silently. The code tries to set the innerHTML of an element with the id "nonExistentDiv", but this element doesn't exist in the HTML.  This can be difficult to debug because there is no obvious error message.  The solution involves checking if the element exists before trying to modify it.
